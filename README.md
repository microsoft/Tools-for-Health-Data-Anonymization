# Overview

FHIR Tools for Anonymization is an open-source project that helps anonymize healthcare [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) data, on-premises or in the cloud, for secondary usage such as research, public health, and more. The project released to open source on Friday, March 6th, 2020.

The core engine uses a [configuration file](#configuration-file-format) specifying the de-identification settings to anonymize the data. The project includes a [command-line tool](#fhir-anonymizer-command-line-tool) that can be used on-premises or in the cloud to anonymize data. It also comes with a [tutorial](#anonymize-fhir-data-using-azure-data-factory) and script to create an ADF pipeline that reads data from Azure blob store and writes anonymized data back to a specified blob store.

This repo contains a [safe harbor configuration file](#sample-configuration-file-for-hipaa-safe-harbor-method) to help de-identify 17 data elements as per [HIPAA Safe Harbor](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#safeharborguidance) method for de-identification. Customers can update the configuration file or create their own configuration file as per their needs by following the [documentation](#configuration-file-format).  

This open source project is fully backed by the Microsoft Healthcare team, but we know that this project will only get better with your feedback and contributions. We are leading the development of this code base, and test builds and deployments daily.

# Quickstarts

## Building the solution
Use the .Net Core 3.1 SDK to build FHIR Tools for Anonymization. If you don't have .Net Core 3.1 installed, instructions and download links are available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

## Get sample FHIR files
This repo contains a few [sample](samples/fhir-r4-files) FHIR files that you can download. These files were generated using  [Synthea&trade; Patient Generator](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea). 

You can also export FHIR resource from your FHIR server using [Bulk Export](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/configure-export-data).

## Anonymize FHIR data using the command line tool
Once you have built the command line tool, you will find the Fhir.Anonymizer.Tool.exe in the $SOURCE\src\Fhir.Anonymizer.Tool\bin\Debug|Release\netcoreapp3.1 folder. You can use this exe to anonymize FHIR resource files in a folder.   
```
> .\Fhir.Anonymizer.Tool.exe -i myInputFolder -o myOutputFolder
```
See the [reference](#the-command-line-tool) section for usage details of the command line tool.

# Tutorials

## Anonymize FHIR data using Azure Data Factory

In this tutorial, you use the Azure PowerShell to create a Data Factory and a pipeline to anonymize FHIR data. The pipeline reads from an Azure blob container, anonymizes it as per the configuration file, and writes the output to another blob container. If you're new to Azure Data Factory, see [Introduction to Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/introduction).

Tutorial steps:

* Use a PowerShell script to create a data factory pipeline.
* Trigger on-demand pipeline run.
* Monitor the pipeline and activity runs.

### Prerequisites

* **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* **Azure storage account**: Azure Blob storage is used as the _source_ & _destination_ data store. If you don't have an Azure storage account, see the instructions in [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal). 
* **Azure PowerShell**: Azure PowerShell is used for deploying azure resources. If you don't have Azure PowerShell installed, see the instructions in [Install the Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-3.4.0)
* **.Net Core 3.1**: Use .Net Core 3.1 sdk to build FHIR Tools for Anonymization. If you don't have .Net Core 3.1 installed, instructions and download links are available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

> **[!NOTE]**
> Ensure that your source and destination blob store, Azure Data Factory, and the Azure batch account created as part of this tutorial are all in the same region.

#### Prepare azure storage resource container

Create a source and a destination container on your blob store. Upload your FHIR files to the source blob container. The pipeline will read the files from the source container and upload the anonymized files to the destination container.

You can also export FHIR resources from a FHIR server using [Bulk Export](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/master/docs/BulkExport.md) and put the data to the source blob container.

#### Log in to Azure using PowerShell
1. Launch **PowerShell** on your machine. Keep PowerShell open until the end of this tutorial. If you close and reopen, you need to run these commands again.

2. Run the following command, and enter the Azure user name and password to sign in to the Azure portal:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

3. Run the following command to view all the subscriptions for this account:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzSubscription
    ```

4. If you see multiple subscriptions associated with your account, run the following command to select the subscription that you want to work with. Replace **SubscriptionId** with the ID of your Azure subscription:

    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId "<SubscriptionId>"
    ```

### Create Data Factory pipeline

1. Locate _AzureDataFactorySettings.json_ in the project and replace the values as described below.

> **[!NOTE]**
> dataFactoryName can contain only lowercase characters or numbers, and must be 3-19 characters in length.
```json
{
  "dataFactoryName": "<Custom Data Factory Name>",
  "resourceLocation": "<Region for Data Factory>",
  "sourceStorageAccountName": "<Storage Account Name for source files>",
  "sourceStorageAccountKey": "<Storage Account Key for source files>",
  "destinationStorageAccountName": "<Storage Account Name for destination files>",
  "destinationStorageAccountKey": "<Storage Account Key for destination files>",
  "sourceStorageContainerName": "<Storage Container Name for source files>",
  "sourceContainerFolderPath": "<Optional: Directory for source resource file path>",
  "destinationStorageContainerName": "<Storage Container Name for destination files>",
  "destinationContainerFolderPath": "<Optional: Directory for destination resource file path>",
  "activityContainerName": "<Container name for anonymizer tool binraries>"
}
```

2. Define the following variables in PowerShell. These are used for creating and configuring the execution batch account. 
```powershell
> $SubscriptionId = "SubscriptionId"
> $BatchAccountName = "BatchAccountName. New batch account would be created if account name is null or empty."
> $BatchAccountPoolName = "BatchAccountPoolName"
> $BatchComputeNodeSize = "Node size for batch node. Default value is 'Standard_d1'"
```

3. Run powershell scripts to create data factory pipeline

```powershell
> .\DeployAzureDataFactoryPipeline.ps1 -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId -BatchAccountName $BatchAccountName -BatchAccountPoolName $BatchAccountPoolName -BatchComputeNodeSize $BatchComputeNodeSize
```

### Trigger and monitor pipeline run from PowerShell

Once a Data Factory pipeline is created, use the following command to trigger pipeline run from PowerShell:

```powershell
> .\DeployAzureDataFactoryPipeline.ps1 -RunPipelineOnly -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId -BatchAccountName $BatchAccountName -BatchAccountPoolName $BatchAccountPoolName -BatchComputeNodeSize $BatchComputeNodeSize
```

Pipeline run result will be shown in console. You will also find stdout and stderr resource links in the result.

```

```
### Trigger and monitor pipeline run from Azure Data Factory portal

You can trigger the pipeline by clicking on the *Add Trigger* button in the pipelines view of the Data Factory portal. You can also view the pipeline run details by going to Monitor => "Pipeline Runs" => Select Pipeline run => show activity outputs.

### Clean up resources

The PowerShell script implicitly creates a resource group by appending 'resourcegroup' to the Data Factory name provided by you in _AzureDataFactorySettings.json_. 

If you want to cleanup resources, delete that resource group in addition to any other resources you may have explicitly created as part of this tutorial.

# Samples

## Sample configuration file for HIPAA Safe Harbor method
FHIR Tools for Anonymization comes with a sample configuration file to help meet the requirements of HIPAA Safe Harbor Method (2)(i). HIPAA Safe Harbor Method (2)(ii) talks about "actual knowledge", which is out of scope for this project.

Out of the 18 identifier types mentioned in HIPAA Safe Harbor method (2)(i), this configuration file deals with the first 17 identifier types (A-Q). The 18th type, (R), is unspecific and hence not considered in this configuration file. 

This configuration file is provided in a best-effort manner. We **strongly** recommend that you review the HIPAA guidelines as well as the implementation of this project before using it for you anonymization requirements. 

The safe harbor configuration file can be accessed [here](samples/configs/safe-harbor-config.json).

# Concepts

## How the engine works
The anonymization engine uses a configuration file specifying different parameters as well as de-identification methods for different data-elements and datatypes. 

The repo contains a [sample configuration file](#sample-configuration-file-for-hipaa-safe-harbor-method), which is based on the [HIPAA Safe Harbor](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#safeharborguidance) method. You can modify the configuration file as needed based on the information provided below.

# Reference

## The command line tool

The command-line tool can be used to anonymize a folder containing FHIR resource files. Here are the parameters that the tool accepts:

| Option | Name | Optionality | Default | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |----- |----- |
| -i | inputFolder | Required | | Folder to locate input resource files. |
| -o | outputFolder | Required | |  Folder to save anonymized resource files. |
| -c | configFile | Optional |configuration-sample.json | Anonymizer configuration file path. It reads the default file from the current directory. |
| -b | bulkData | Optional| false | Resource file is in bulk data format (.ndjson). |
| -r | recursive | Optional | false | Process resource files in input folder recursively. |
| -v | verbose | Optional | false | Provide additional details during processing. |


Example usage to anonymize FHIR resource files in a folder: 
```
> .\Fhir.Anonymizer.Tool.exe -i myInputFolder -o myOutputFolder
```

## Configuration file format

The configuration is specified in JSON format. It has three high-level sections. Two of these sections, namely _pathRules_, and _typeRules_ are meant to specify de-identification methods for data elements. De-identification configuration specified in the _pathRules_ section override the corresponding configurations in the _typeRules_ section. The third section named _parameters_ affect global behavior.

Here is a sample configuration:

```json
{
  "pathRules": {
    "Patient.address.state": "keep",
    "Patient.address.country": "redact"
  },
  "typeRules": {
    "date": "dateShift",
    "Address": "redact"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "dateShiftKey": "",
    "enablePartialAgesForRedact": true
}
```

### Path Rules
Path rules are key-value pairs that can be used to specify the de-identification methods for individual elements. Ex:

```json
"Patient.address.state": "keep"
```
The elements can be specified using [FHIRPath](http://hl7.org/fhirpath/) syntax. The method can be one from the following table.

|Method| Applicable to | Description
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
|keep|All elements| Retains the value as is. |
|redact|All elements| Removes the element. See the parameters section below to handle special cases.|
|dateShift|Elements of type date, dateTime, and instant | Shifts the value using the [Date-shift algorithm](#date-shift-algorithm).

### Type Rules
Type rules are key-value pairs that can be used to specify the de-identification methods at the datatype level. Ex:

```json
"date": "dateShift"
```
The datatypes can be any of the [FHIR datatypes](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html). The method can be one from the following table.

|Method| Applicable to | Description
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
|keep|All datatypes | Retains the value as is. |
|redact|All datatypes| Removes the element. See the parameters section below to handle special cases. |
|dateShift|date, dateTime, and instant datatypes | Shifts the value using the [Date-shift algorithm](#date-shift-algorithm).

### Parameters
Parameters affect the de-identification methods specified in the type rules and path rules. 

|Method| Parameter | Affected fields | Valid values | Default value | Description
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| dateShift |dateShiftKey|date, dateTime, instant fields| string|A randomly generated string|This key in conjunction with the FHIR resource id is used in the [Date-shift algorithm](#date-shift-algorithm). 
| redact | enablePartialAgesForRedact |Age fields | boolean | false | If the value is set to **true**, only age values over 89 will be redacted. |
| redact | enablePartialDatesForRedact  | date, dateTime, instant fields | boolean | false | If the value is set to **true**, date, dateTime, instant will keep year if indicative age is not over 89. |
| redact | enablePartialZipCodesForRedact  | Zip Code fields | boolean | false | If the value is set to **true**, Zip Code will be redacted as per the HIPAA Safe Harbor rule. |
| redact | restrictedZipCodeTabulationAreas  | Zip Code fields | a JSON array | empty array | This configuration is used only if enablePartialZipCodesForRedact is set to **true**. This field contains the list of zip codes for which the first 3 digits will be converted to 0. As per the HIPAA Safe Harbor, this list will have the Zip Codes  having population less than 20,000 people. |

## Date-shift algorithm
You can specify dateShift as a de-identification method in the configuration file. With this method, the input date/dateTime/instant value will be shifted within a 100-day differential. The following algorithm is used to shift the target dates:

### Input
* A date/dateTime/instant value (required)
* FHIR resource id (optional). If not specified, an empty string will be used.
* Date shift key (optional). If not specified, a randomly generated string will be used.

### Output
* A shifted date/datetime/instant value

### Steps
1. Create a string by combining FHIR resource id and date shift key.
2. Feed the above string to hash function to get an integer between [-50, 50]. 
3. Use the above integer as the offset to shift the input date/dateTime/instant value

### Note

1. If the input date/dateTime/instant value does not contain an exact day, for example dates with only a year ("yyyy") or only a year and month ("yyyy-MM"), the date cannot be shifted and redaction will be applied.
2. If the input date/dateTime/instant value is indicative of age over 89, it will be redacted (including year) according to HIPAA Safe Harbor Method.
3. If the input dateTime/instant value contains time, time will be redacted. Time zone will keep unchanged.

# Resources

## Current limitations
1. We only support FHIR data in R4, JSON format. Support for XML and STU 3 is planned.
2. Date-shift algorithm shifts the dates within a resource by the same random amount. We are working on the ability to shift the dates by the same random amount across resources. 
3. The source and the destination blob store, the ADF pipeline, and the Azure batch account must all be in the same region for the ADF pipeline to work reliably.

## FAQ
### How can we use FHIR Tools for Anonymization to anonymize HL7 v2.x data
You can build a pipeline to use [FHIR converter](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter) to convert HL7 v2.x data to FHIR format, and subsequently use FHIR Tools for Anonymization to anonymize your data. 

### Can we use custom de-identification methods?
Currently you can use the prebuilt de-identification methods and control their behavior by passing parameters. We are planning to support custom de-identification methods in future.
