She has been at her current weight for several weeks and feels that she has stabilized. Appetite has been good. \n\n\n\nHome Blood Tests:  No records. She reports that she drops from the 200's to the normal range in the morning. Her bedtime test is about 3-4 hours after summer.  \n\nRetinopathy:\tSaw Dr. Xiques in the Spring. May need laser for p-cataract film. Retinas stable.\n\nNephropathy:\tCr 1.0 in September. Saw Dr. Caldwell re her Charcot foot. He put her in a boot and wheelchair for 3 weeks and it resolved well. \n\nCardiac:\tGets little tingling sensations in her anterior chest, occurring at any times. Not specifically at times of physical exercise. \n\nVascular:\tNo claudication\n\n\n\nPast Medical History: \n\nMedications: Prograf reduced.\n\n\n\nReview of Systems: \n\nGI: Feels that her abdomen is uncomfortable much of the time. Not precipitated or relieved by food. Upper and lower abdominal. No change in volume or nature of ileostomy output. She has dysphagia for liquids, sometimes with regurgitation. \n\nHad Pap and mammogram through ANC gynecologist.\n\nShe saw Dr. Wilhelm for sinus problems. He got an MRI. It showed a meningioma of the jugular foramen. Dr. Wilhelm's note indicated that she would see Dr. New for that and indeed she has seen Dr. New, although she says it is for a tumor on the vocal cord. \n\nHe also wanted her to see Dr. Carter about a vocal cord paralysis, and that visit is upcoming. \n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\t\n\nLooks well.\n\nBP:   118/70\t\tP:   72, regular\n\nWt:   118.5 without shoes, down 8.5\n\nHEENT:\tAnicteric. \n\nCarotids:\tNormal pulses, without bruits\n\nChest:\tClear to auscultation\n\nHeart:\tDyskinetic prominent apical impulse. Normal S1; single S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur\n\nAbdomen:\tNo hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. Small epigastric hernia with mild tenderness in that area. Ileostomy. No palpable AAA. \n\nExtremities:\tNo edema.       DP 2+,=.  PT absent. Prominent mound of tissue in the plantar aspect of L foot, from Charcot changes, but with very normal skin covering.  Good foot care.\n\n\n\nImpressions and Plan:\t\n\nMany active issues.\n\nHard to assess control without data. Must bring them to visits.\n\nFor now, reduce the Lantus to 8 U since she drops overnight by history.\n\nWill need to talk with Dr. Wilhelm and Dr. New about their respective perspectives and figure out who is addressing the meningioma and hydrocephalus. May need to see a neurologist. \n\nRefer to Dr. Sanders for evaluation of her gastrointestinal discomfort and dysphagia for liquids. I suspect a motility disorder.\n\nShe needs follow-up with Dr. Arndt. \n\n1 hour; most counseling and coordination of care.\n\nA1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, CBC, anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, TSH.\n\n\n\nAppointments:\t1 month\n\n\n\ncc:\tTransplant Clinic\n\n\tFredrich van Butler, M.D.\n\n\tNicole Arndt, M.D.\n\n\tLawrence Wilhelm, M.D., Minnie Hamilton Health Care Center, 727 Seneca Drive, Suite 9B,\n\n\t\t Red Springs, WA 77286\n\n\tNicholas New, M.D., BKMC\n\n\tOphelia Sanders, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLawrence K.

Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 93 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. He was admitted to ODC in May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/ Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent. The lesion was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. he is now admitted to the Cardiology department for post procedure monitoring and arrived to cardio clinic pain free and hemodynamically stable.\n\tPast medical history:\n   DM \nHTN \nHyperlipidemia \nCAD -CABG x 3 September 2092 WMMC (LIMA to D2, SVG to RCA, SVG to LAD) s/p PCI prox LAD Jan 2093, s/p Taxus stent to LAD 5/94 \nGERD s/p H pylori eradication several years ago \nLeft rotator cuff injury s/p CABG \nAnxiety \nhernia repair\n\t\n\tChanges to Allergies\n\t\nACE Inhibitor - reaction: cough [reviewed]\nMETFORMIN - reaction: GI Intolerance [reviewed]\nROSUVASTATIN - reaction: myalgia [reviewed]\nSIMVASTATIN - reaction: myalgias [reviewed]\nVALSARTAN - reaction: fatigue [reviewed]\n\tSocial history:\n   Lives with wife in Lagrange,KS.
